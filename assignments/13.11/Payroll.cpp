/*
 * Design a PayRoll class that has data members for an employeeâ€™s 
 * hourly pay rate, number of hours worked, and total pay for the week. 
 * Write a program with an array of seven  PayRoll  objects. 
 * The program should ask the user for the number of hours each employee 
 * has worked and will then display the amount of gross pay each has earned.
