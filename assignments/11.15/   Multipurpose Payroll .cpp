/*
 * Write a program that calculates pay for either an hourly paid worker
 * or a salaried worker. Hourly paid workers are paid their hourly pay rate 
 * times the number of hours worked. Salaried workers are paid their regular 
 * salary plus any bonus they may have earned. The program should declare two 
 * structures for the following data:     
 * Hourly Paid:     
 * HoursWorked    
 * HourlyRate       
 
 * Salaried:     
 * Salary    
 * Bonus   
 * The program should also declare a  union  with two members. 
 * Each member should be a structure variable: one for the hourly paid worker 
 * and another for the salaried worker.
 * The program should ask the user whether he or she is calculating the pay
 * for an hourly paid worker or a salaried worker. Regardless of which the user
 * selects, the appropriate members of the  union  will be used to store 
 * the data that will be used to calculate the pay.
